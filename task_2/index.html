                <p>The game follows Kris, a human, and their new friend Susie, as they are pulled into the Dark World, a mysterious realm ruled by the Dark Fountain. There, they meet Ralsei, a kind prince who claims to be a "Darkner" destined to maintain balance. The trio forms a "party" and embarks on a quest to seal the Dark Fountain and prevent the prophesied "Roaring"â€”a catastrophic event that could end the world.</p>
